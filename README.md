# Blog with handlebars

This is a blog mockup. 
It uses handlebars for rendering and sequelize for the database.


## How to run

```nodemon server.js```

or 

```node server.js```

## Notes

At the moment there seems to be a bug where the data wont load until ```npm run seed``` is ran AFTER the server is started.
